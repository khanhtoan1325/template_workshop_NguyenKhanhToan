## Overview

This workshop walks through the architecture and implementation of a cloud-native video localization platform. The system automates subtitle extraction, translation, voice generation, and final video rendering so multilingual video processing becomes faster, more scalable, and more cost-effective.

The workshop is organized around the actual project structure in this repository, covering the backend services, AI/ML pipeline, frontend application, and deployment flow used to deliver the platform end to end.

## What You Will Build

By following this workshop, you will understand how to build a system that can:

- Upload and validate video files
- Extract subtitles using OCR or Speech-to-Text
- Translate subtitle content with context-aware AI
- Generate dubbed audio using Text-to-Speech providers
- Render final videos with subtitles and/or voice-over
- Track processing progress in real time

## Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Celery, Redis, MySQL
- **AI/ML**: PaddleOCR, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Google Gemini, gTTS, ElevenLabs
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg, MoviePy
- **Infrastructure**: Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon SES, Docker
